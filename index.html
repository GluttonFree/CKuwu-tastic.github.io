            Kayely for some reason holds disdain for this image of her, but I (being Caleb) digress. This is one of the most beautiful pictures of Kayley I have! The lighting is so gorgeous (no where near as gorgeous as her though)! Her pink dress is exquisite and compliments her personal taste in color! I can't express how much I love this picture! Even if she dislikes it, she has to admit that it helped me fall more in love with her with every second I look at it!
