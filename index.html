           Caleb: Kayely for some reason holds disdain for this image of her, but I digress. This is one of the most beautiful pictures of Kayley I have! The lighting is so gorgeous (no where near as gorgeous as her though)! Her pink dress is exquisite and compliments her personal taste in color! The way her curly blonde hair rests upon her shoulders makes me kick my feet! I can't express how much I love this picture! Even if she dislikes it, she has to admit that it helped me fall more in love with her with every second I look at it!

           Kayley: This picture of Caleb was the first picture that I received of him that made me just stare. Seeing his adorable brwon locks ruffled into the mushed formation of the goggles was too much for my young heart to handle. I was lucky that I didn't have a heartattack. The blue shirt matches his beautiful blue eyes perfectly, and the headphones show a nerdy cuteness that only a stoic could resist. Seeing him on campus walking to class brought out his brilliance and made me realize how mature and perfect he was!
